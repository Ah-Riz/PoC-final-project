# Aegis Protocol - One-Page Summary

## Executive Overview

**Aegis Protocol** is the first privacy-preserving lending protocol for DeFi, using zero-knowledge proofs to hide collateral amounts while cryptographically proving loan safety.

---

## The Problem → Solution → Market

| **Problem** | **Solution** | **Market** |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| DeFi is too transparent | Private lending via ZK proofs | $15-20B addressable TAM |
| $700M+ MEV attacks in 2024 | Collateral hidden, safety proven | 30-40% of users want privacy |
| Institutions won't use DeFi | Mathematically guaranteed privacy | $150B institutional capital waiting |

---

## Product (3 Key Features)

1. **Private Deposits** - Lock collateral without revealing amount  
2. **ZK-Proven Borrows** - Loans verified in <2 seconds, $0.03 cost  
3. **Full Privacy** - No link between deposit and borrow wallets  

---

## Traction & Proof

**Technical Validation:**
- ✅ Working PoC (3 weeks to build)
- ✅ 100% test coverage
- ✅ <2 second proof generation
- ✅ 100x cheaper than Ethereum L1

**Next Milestones:**
- Q1 2025: Security audit + mainnet launch
- Q2 2025: $50M TVL target
- Q3 2025: Series A raise

---

## Business Model

**Revenue:** 2-3% protocol fee on all borrows  
**Projections (Year 1):**
- Conservative: $50M TVL → $1M ARR
- Moderate: $200M TVL → $4.8M ARR  
- Aggressive: $500M TVL → $15M ARR

**Path to Profitability:** 6-9 months at $100M+ TVL

---

## Competitive Advantage

**vs. Traditional DeFi (Aave/Compound):**  
✅ Privacy | ✅ 100x cheaper | ✅ Same capital efficiency

**vs. Privacy Projects (Tornado Cash):**  
✅ Legal | ✅ Lending (not just mixing) | ✅ Compliant

**Moat:** 12-18 month technical lead, Mantle-native advantages, first-mover

## Why Now?

**Perfect convergence of 3 forces:**
1. Technology ready (SP1 + EigenDA production-grade)
2. Market demand ($150B institutional capital waiting)
3. Competitive window (no ZK lending exists yet)

**This is the moment. Privacy-preserving DeFi starts here.**
