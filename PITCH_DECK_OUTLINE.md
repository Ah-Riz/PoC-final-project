- ❌ Your wallet: Tracked across protocols
- ❌ Result: Front-running, MEV, surveillance

**Impact:**
- Institutions stay away
- Whales get targeted
- Innovation stifled

**Content:**

**Total Addressable Market**
- DeFi Lending: $50B+ TVL
- Privacy-seeking: 30-40% of users
- **TAM: $200B+**

**Serviceable Addressable Market**
- Institutional + High-net-worth
- **SAM: $80B**

**Serviceable Obtainable Market**
- Year 1-2 capture
- **SOM: $500M-$1B**

**Key Insight:** Privacy is the #1 blocker for $150B in institutional capital

## Slide 5: The Solution
**Visual:** Simple diagram of the protocol  
**Content:**

**Aegis Protocol: Private Lending via Zero-Knowledge**

```
Deposit → Hidden    Borrow → Verified
 10 ETH   ████      $5K     ✓ Safe
(Hidden)  Proof     (Public) (Proven)
```

**Key Innovation:**
- Collateral amounts: **Hidden**
- Loan safety: **Cryptographically proven**
- User privacy: **Mathematically guaranteed**

**Tagline:** *"Borrow in public, with private collateral"*

---

## Slide 6: How It Works (Simple)
**Visual:** 3-step diagram with icons  
**Content:**

**Step 1: Private Deposit**
- User locks collateral (amount encrypted)
- Creates cryptographic commitment
- On-chain: Only a hash visible

**Step 2: Zero-Knowledge Proof**
- Off-chain: Prove loan is safe
- Without revealing: Collateral amount
- 2 seconds, $0.03 cost

**Step 3: Verified Borrow**
- On-chain: Contract verifies proof
- Transfer: Borrowed funds released
- Privacy: Maintained throughout

---

## Slide 7: Demo (Screenshots or Live)
**Visual:** Screen recording or screenshots  
**Content:**

**Live Demonstration:**
- Deposit: $1M hidden collateral
- Borrow: $200K from different wallet
- Observer view: Can't link transactions
- Proof time: <2 seconds

**Key Metrics:**
- ✓ Proof generated: 1.8s
- ✓ Gas cost: $0.03 (100x cheaper than L1)
- ✓ Privacy: 256-bit security
- ✓ All tests: Passing
